COVID-19 model for Benton County, OR
======
This project models the spread of COVID-19 in Benton County, OR (home of Oregon State University) with an [SEIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model). 

The code was run using Octave 5.2.0. I have not tested it in MATLAB.

To run the model, open the octave shell and run:<br>
`> pkg load optim`<br>
`> run model`
